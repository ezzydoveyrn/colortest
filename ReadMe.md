# Test Colors  

This is a simple web application that allows users to change the background color by typing or pasting a color name into an input field. The last selected color is stored in localStorage to persist between page reloads.  

## Features  

- Users can enter a color name in the input field and press *Enter* to change the background color.  
- The chosen color is saved in localStorage, so it remains after refreshing the page.  
- The input box is styled for a clean and modern look.  

## Files  

- index.html – Structure of the web page.  
- app.css – Styling for the page layout and input box.  
- app.js – JavaScript functionality for changing and saving the background color.  

## How to Use  

1. Open index.html in a browser.  
2. Type a valid color name (e.g., blue, green, #ff5733) into the input box.  
3. Press *Enter* to apply the color to the background.  

## Local Storage  

The color is stored in localStorage, so the background remains the same even after closing and reopening the page.  

## Future Improvements  

- Add color validation to check if the entered value is a valid color.  
- Include a color picker for easier selection.  
- Allow users to reset to the default background color.
